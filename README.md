Card Swipe is a social media application that allows users to interact with pictures by swiping left or right. Swiping left indicates liking a picture, while swiping right indicates disliking a picture. The application provides visual feedback for each action by displaying a checkmark with a green background for likes and a cross with a red background for dislikes.
